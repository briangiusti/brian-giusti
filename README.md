# About this project

This project hosts my portfilio site! I was sitting by my desk one day and my national park magnet
fell off metal desk leg it sits on. It conveyed so much information about the place with just a since word.
Thinking about that I thought my website should be the same, simple and fun. 


## About the algorithm for positioning magnets

I started with DnD Kit found here [https://docs.dndkit.com/](https://docs.dndkit.com/)

They have a great sandbox testing ground and I wanted the draggable piece of their code. 
I actually didn't need a droppable area since the whole window is "droppable".

So in src/functions/handleDragEvent I created a small function to update the positon of magnet.
